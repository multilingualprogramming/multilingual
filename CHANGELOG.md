## [Unreleased]

### Added

#### WAT/WASM backend — string operations
- **String content equality (`==` / `!=`)**: comparisons where both operands are string-valued
  now lower to a new `$__str_eq` WAT helper that compares UTF-8 byte ranges, instead of comparing
  heap pointers. This makes `s[i] == "F"`, `slice == literal`, and string-valued method results
  compare by content. Variables bound to a string subscript/slice/method result (`ch = s[i]`) now
  retain string-length tracking, so equality on them compares content too.
- **`str(x)` number-to-string conversion**: `str(42)` → `"42"`, `str(3.14)` → `"3.14"` via new
  `$__str_from_f64` WAT helper. Correctly formats integers without a decimal point and floats with
  up to 6 significant decimal digits (trailing zeros trimmed). String and string-variable arguments
  pass through unchanged.
- **F-string numeric interpolation**: `f"{x}"` where `x` is a numeric `f64` variable now calls
  `$__str_from_f64`, producing correct float output (`f"{3.14}"` → `"3.14"` rather than `"3"`).
- **String method `.upper()` / `.lower()`**: ASCII case conversion, returns heap-allocated copy.
- **String method `.startswith(prefix)` / `.endswith(suffix)`**: Returns `0.0` / `1.0`.
- **String method `.count(needle)`**: Counts non-overlapping occurrences; returns f64.
- **String method `.replace(old, new)`**: Replaces all occurrences; returns heap-allocated copy.
- **`str()` recognized as string-valued**: `_is_string_value` updated so `str(x)` composes
  correctly inside f-strings and string concatenation.

#### WAT/WASM backend — math
- **`math.sin` / `math.cos` / `math.tan`**: Horner-polynomial approximations (6-term).
- **`math.exp`**: 10-term Horner polynomial for e^x.
- **`math.log` / `math.log2` / `math.log10`**: atanh-series natural log; scaled for base 2/10.
- **`math.atan` / `math.atan2`**: 6-term series with |x|>1 identity; quadrant-adjusted atan2.
- **`math.trunc` / `math.hypot` / `math.degrees` / `math.radians`**: Inline WAT lowering.
- **`math.pi` / `math.e` / `math.tau` / `math.inf` / `math.nan`**: Emitted as `f64.const` literals.

#### WAT/WASM backend — list allocation
- **Runtime-sized list repeat `[elem] * n`**: a single-element list literal multiplied by a
  runtime count now allocates an `n`-length list (layout `[length_f64, elem0, ...]`) filled with
  the repeated element, instead of falling through to numeric multiplication. The result is tracked
  as a list, so `buf[i] = ...`, `buf[i]`, and `len(buf)` work — enabling O(n) buffer fills
  (e.g. two-pass count-then-write) rather than O(n²) `append` chains under the bump allocator.
  Recognised in either operand order (`[0.0] * n` or `n * [0.0]`).

#### WAT/WASM backend — list mutation
- **`list.append(x)`**: `$__list_append` allocates a new block with `count+1` slots, copies
  existing data, appends the element, and updates the local variable.
- **`list.pop()`**: `$__list_pop` decrements the count in-place and returns the last element;
  works in both statement and expression contexts.
- **`list.extend(other)`**: `$__list_extend` merges two lists into a new heap block.
- **`list(existing_list)`**: Produces a shallow copy when called with an existing list local.

#### WAT/WASM backend — iteration
- **`enumerate(lst)` in `for` loops**: `for i, x in enumerate(lst)` lowers to a counted list
  loop that unpacks the two-element tuple target `(i, x)` via `_emit_sequence_len_setup` /
  `_emit_sequence_value_load`.
- **`list(map(fn, lst))`**: Applies a known WAT function to every element of a list local;
  produces a new list of the same length.
- **`list(filter(fn, lst))`**: Keeps elements where `fn` returns a truthy value; count updated
  after the loop.

#### WAT/WASM backend — dict methods
- **`dict.values()`**: Returns the dict pointer itself (dicts are stored as f64 value lists).
- **`dict.keys()`**: Allocates a new list of interned string pointers for each compile-time key.
- **`dict.items()`**: Allocates an outer list of 2-element `[key_ptr, val]` tuple pairs.
- **`dict.get(key)` / `dict.get(key, default)`**: Compile-time string-literal key lookup;
  returns the element f64, the default expression, or `0.0` if the key is absent.

#### WAT/WASM backend — OOP / type checking
- **`isinstance(obj, ClassName)`**: Emits a type-tag check at `obj_ptr - 8` against the
  compile-time class ID from `_class_ids`. Returns `1.0` (true) or `0.0` (false) as f64.
- **OOP state reset fix**: `_static_method_names`, `_property_getters`, `_class_ids`, and
  `_dispatch_func_names` are now reset between `generate()` calls, eliminating stale OOP
  state that could corrupt subsequent compilations in the same generator instance.

#### WAT/WASM backend — DOM
- **`dom_on(handle, event, callback)`**: Registers a WAT function-table callback for a DOM
  event. The generated module exports `__dom_dispatch(idx)` which JS calls on the event;
  `ml_dom_on` host import added to the DOM bridge.

#### WAT/WASM backend — JSON
- **`json.dumps(list)`**: Encodes a tracked f64 list as a JSON array string
  (`[n1,n2,...]`) using a new `$__json_encode_list` WAT helper.

#### WAT/WASM backend — generators
- **`yield from range(n)`**: Now materializes correctly via Shape 1b in `_simple_generator_spec`.

### Fixed
- **`math.sin` / `math.cos` returned the negated value**: both helpers began with an
  uncompensated `x += pi` phase shift, so they computed `sin(x+pi) = -sin(x)` and
  `cos(x+pi) = -cos(x)` — e.g. `math.cos(0.0)` returned `-1.0`. Removed the spurious shift;
  range reduction and the polynomial now yield correct values (`cos(0)=1`, `sin(pi/2)≈1`,
  `cos(4pi)=1`). `math.tan` (defined as `sin/cos`) is corrected transitively.
- **F-string float formatting**: Default `{x}` interpolation previously truncated floats to
  their integer part; now delegates to `$__str_from_f64` for correct output.
- **`math.atan` WAT stack error**: The conditional negation inside `if` without a declared
  result type caused a WASM validation failure; fixed by saving the result to `(local $r f64)`.
- **`$__json_encode_list` copy-index clobbering**: Inner copy loop used `$i` (element index)
  as its write pointer, corrupting output after the first element; fixed with a separate `$ci`.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-03-09

### Added
- **WAT/WASM OOP object model**: Stateful classes (those with `self.attr = …` assignments)
  now use a linear-memory bump allocator in generated WAT. Each field is an `f64` stored at
  a compile-time-computed byte offset. Object pointers are carried as `f64` values and
  converted at field-access sites via `i32.trunc_f64_u` / `f64.convert_i32_u`.
- **Heap-pointer global**: `(global $__heap_ptr (mut i32) …)` is emitted only when at least
  one stateful class is present; `HEAP_BASE` is aligned to 8 bytes after the string data section.
- **`self.attr` store/load lowering**: Attribute writes (`self.x = val`) compile to `f64.store`;
  attribute reads (`self.x`) compile to `f64.load`. Compound assignments (`self.x += delta`)
  use a temporary `f64` local to avoid address recomputation issues.
- **External `obj.attr` reads**: `obj.attr` outside the class body lowers to `f64.load` when
  the variable's class is statically known from local assignments.
- **Stateful instance method calls**: Instance method calls (`obj.method(…)`) pass the actual
  heap address as `self` (as `f64`) for stateful classes; stateless classes keep the old
  `f64.const 0` behavior.
- **Inheritance and method resolution in WAT/WASM**: Subclass hierarchies are now resolved
  at WAT-emit time; inherited methods are dispatched to the correct parent-class WAT export.
- **`with` statement lowering in WAT**: Context-manager blocks (`with expr as var`) lower to
  WAT with enter/exit call sequences.
- **`try/except` lowering in WAT**: Try-except blocks compile to WAT control-flow blocks,
  providing structured exception handling in the WASM backend.
- **`lambda` lowering in WAT**: Lambda expressions lower to anonymous WAT functions with
  captured parameters forwarded as explicit arguments.
- **`match/case` lowering in WAT**: Structural pattern-matching statements lower to WAT
  `if/else` chains using equality comparisons.
- **`async/await` lowering in WAT**: Async function definitions and `await` expressions lower
  to synchronous WAT equivalents with stub scheduling hooks.
- **`@property` setter/getter in WAT**: Property descriptors (`@property`, `@x.setter`) lower
  to distinct WAT getter/setter exports following the established class-method mangling scheme.
- **Bytes literals in WAT**: `b"..."` byte-string literals are stored in the WAT data section
  and referenced by pointer/length pairs.
- **WAT generation organized by themes**: The WAT backend code is now split into focused
  modules by language construct theme (control flow, OOP, literals, builtins) for maintainability.
- **`TupleLiteral` code generation fix**: Tuple literals now wrap generated elements in
  parentheses, producing correctly parenthesized WAT output.
- **Updated builtin aliases**: Expanded localized builtin alias coverage across supported languages.
- **New WAT OOP tests** in `tests/wat_generator_test.py`:
  - `WATOopObjectModelTestSuite` — 6 WAT pattern tests (no wasmtime required).
  - 3 new execution tests in `WATClassWasmExecutionTestSuite`: single-field counter get,
    increment-then-get, and two independent instances.
- **`docs/wat_oop_model.md`**: Reference document covering the object model design, memory
  layout, field layout rules, constructor sequence, store/load patterns, limitations, and a
  full end-to-end WAT example.
- **`AGENTS.md`**: Agent guidance document for AI-assisted development workflows in this repository.

### Changed
- Stateless classes (no `self.attr` assignments) are unaffected and keep the `f64.const 0`
  self path — no existing tests are broken.
- WAT backend source split into themed sub-modules for clarity and maintainability.

### Fixed
- `TupleLiteral` code generation now wraps output in parentheses (previously emitted bare elements).
- Various WAT backend correctness fixes surfaced during gap-filling and test stabilization.

  - `ClassName(...)` lowers to class `__init__` in WAT with implicit `self` handling.
  - `Class.method(...)` lowers to mangled class method exports.
  - `obj = Class(...); obj.method(...)` lowers via lightweight local class-type tracking.
- **Executable WASM validation for complete features**:
  - New test `tests/complete_features_wasm_execution_test.py` compiles every `examples/complete_features_*.multi` from WAT to binary WASM, materializes `.wat/.wasm` artifacts, instantiates modules, and executes `__main`.
- **CI workflow gate for complete-feature WASM execution**:
  - `.github/workflows/wasm-backends-test.yml` now runs the new complete-feature WAT/WASM execution test on primary WASM jobs.

### Changed
