# Release Notes

## v0.7.0 - 2026-05-23

### Core 1 Runtime, AI, And Backend Expansion

This release moves Multilingual beyond the 0.6 WAT/WASM milestone into a broader Core 1 platform
preview: AI-native runtime pieces, semantic IR tooling, reactive UI output, and a deeper
WAT/WASM backend.

#### AI-Native Runtime
- Added runtime support for prompts, generation, extraction, embeddings, reasoning, streaming,
  caching, model registry/routing, prompt optimization, retrieval, memory stores, tools, agents,
  and swarm-style delegation.
- Added provider adapters for OpenAI, Anthropic, and Ollama behind optional `[ai]` dependencies.
- Added typed AI result/value helpers and tests under `tests/core1/`.

#### Core 1, UI, And CLI
- Added semantic IR commands: `multilingual ir`, `multilingual explain`, and `--mode core`.
- Added reactive UI lowering plus `build-ui-bundle` and `ui-preview` commands.
- Added WAT ABI helper commands for manifests, host shims, and renderer templates.

#### WAT/WASM Backend
- Expanded math support and fixed numeric accuracy for trigonometric, logarithmic, exponential,
  atan/atan2, hypot, degree/radian, and constants lowering.
- Added richer string support: length-preserving string parameters, content equality, `str()`,
  f-string numeric interpolation, ASCII case conversion, prefix/suffix/count/replace helpers,
  indexing, slicing, and host string allocation.
- Added list-return propagation, runtime-sized list repeat, list mutation/copy helpers,
  `enumerate`, `map`, `filter`, dictionary method lowering, `json.dumps(list)`, type-tagged
  `isinstance`, DOM callback dispatch, and `yield from range(n)` materialization.

#### Packaging
- Bumped package version to `0.7.0`.
- Added optional extras: `[ai]` for AI providers and `[all]` for WASM, performance, and AI
  dependencies together.

## v0.6.0 - 2026-03-09

### WAT/WASM Backend — Full Construct Coverage

This release completes the WAT/WASM backend with full support for all major Python-like language
constructs, OOP patterns, and compatibility fixes across the code generator.

#### OOP Object Model
- Stateful classes use a linear-memory bump allocator in generated WAT; each `self.attr` field
  is stored as `f64` at a compile-time byte offset.
- `(global $__heap_ptr (mut i32) …)` is emitted only when stateful classes are present.
- `self.attr` writes lower to `f64.store`; reads lower to `f64.load`; compound assignments
  (`self.x += delta`) use a temporary local to avoid address recomputation.
- External `obj.attr` reads lower to `f64.load` when the variable's class is statically known.
- Instance method calls pass the actual heap address as `self` for stateful classes.

#### Inheritance and Method Resolution
- Subclass hierarchies are resolved at WAT-emit time; inherited methods dispatch to the correct
  parent-class WAT export.

#### New Control-Flow Constructs in WAT
- `with` statement: context-manager blocks lower to WAT enter/exit call sequences.
- `try/except`: structured exception-handling blocks compile to WAT `if/else` control flow.
- `lambda`: anonymous functions lower to WAT functions with explicit argument forwarding.
- `match/case`: structural pattern matching lowers to WAT `if/else` chains.
- `async/await`: async functions and `await` lower to synchronous WAT equivalents.

#### Property and Literals
- `@property` setter/getter descriptors lower to distinct WAT getter/setter exports.
- `b"..."` bytes literals stored in the WAT data section; referenced by pointer/length pairs.
- `TupleLiteral` code generation now correctly wraps elements in parentheses.

#### Architecture
- WAT backend source reorganized into themed sub-modules (control flow, OOP, literals, builtins).
- Updated builtin aliases for expanded localized coverage.

#### Documentation and Tooling
- `docs/wat_oop_model.md`: reference document for the WAT OOP object model design.
- `AGENTS.md`: agent guidance for AI-assisted development workflows.

#### Quality
- All WAT backend correctness fixes from gap-filling and test stabilization applied.

## v0.5.1
- Update documentation

## v0.5.0 

### Class Support in WAT/WASM
- Extended `WATCodeGenerator` to lower class methods to standalone WAT functions.
- Added lowering for constructor-style calls (`ClassName(...)`) to class `__init__` with implicit `self`.
- Added lowering for class attribute calls (`Class.method(...)`) and simple instance method calls (`obj.method(...)`) when object type can be inferred from local assignments.
- Added targeted regressions for class lowering and call lowering in `tests/wat_generator_test.py`.

### Complete Features: Real WASM Executability Gate
- Added `tests/complete_features_wasm_execution_test.py` to validate all `examples/complete_features_*.multi` end-to-end:
  - parse multilingual source
  - generate WAT
  - compile WAT to binary WASM
  - write `.wat` and `.wasm` artifacts
  - instantiate and execute `__main` in Wasmtime
- Added Wasmtime fuel metering in this test to bound runtime for heavy complete-feature programs while preserving executable validation.

### Unicode Identifier Reliability
- Added deterministic WAT symbol sanitization for generated function/local/parameter identifiers.
- Preserved original exported function names while using WAT-safe internal `$symbols`.
- Fixed previously failing WAT→WASM compilation paths for non-ASCII identifiers (for example Arabic identifiers in complete-feature examples).

### CI Workflow Updates
- Updated `.github/workflows/wasm-backends-test.yml` to include a primary-job gate that runs complete-feature WAT/WASM artifact + execution validation.
- This adds a dedicated regression barrier for executable WASM quality, not just WAT text validity.

### Quality and Stability
- Full test suite status after integration: `1778 passed, 2 skipped`.
- Pylint checks on touched files remain clean (`10.00/10` in targeted runs).

## v0.4.0 

### WAT/WASM Code Generation
- New `WATCodeGenerator` compiles the multilingual AST directly to WebAssembly Text (WAT).
- Browser playground shows the generated WAT and executes it via wabt.js + native `WebAssembly.instantiate()`.
- Playground also shows the generated Rust/Wasmtime bridge scaffold for local compilation.
- Regression tests validate WAT output across all 17 languages (`tests/complete_features_wat_test.py`).

### WASM Backend
- WebAssembly compilation target with performance gains on compute-intensive operations.
- Python ↔ WASM bridge for type conversion and memory management.
- Smart backend selector for auto-detection and transparent fallback to Python.
- 25+ pure Python fallback implementations for guaranteed cross-platform compatibility.
- 20 multilingual WASM corpus projects in 4 languages each.
- Documentation suite: WASM architecture overview, installation guides, performance tuning, troubleshooting, and FAQ.

### REPL Code-View Commands
- `:wat` (`:wasm`) — toggle display of generated WAT before execution.
- `:rust` (`:wasmtime`) — toggle display of generated Rust/Wasmtime bridge code before execution.
- `--show-wat` and `--show-rust` startup flags for the `repl` subcommand mirror the interactive toggles.
- Extends the existing `:python` / `--show-python` pattern uniformly across all three backends.

### Python 3.12 Feature Completion
- All 17 `complete_features_XX.multi` example files now cover the full Python 3.12 feature checklist: numeric literals, augmented and bitwise assignments, chained assignment, type annotations, ternary expressions, default/variadic parameters, lambdas, list/dict/generator/nested/filtered comprehensions, `try/except/else`, exception chaining, multiple handlers, `match/case/default`, decorators, multiple inheritance, static/class methods, properties, and docstrings.
- Keyword-variable name clashes (Spanish `y` = AND, Danish/Swedish `i` = IN) resolved in example files.

### Quality and Fixes
- Fixed broken relative links (`../CHANGELOG.md`, `../USAGE.md`, `../examples/README.md`) in `docs/reference.md` and `docs/fr/programmation.md`.
- CLI `multilingual run <file>.ml` correctly handles `.ml` file execution.
- New tests: `language_completeness_cli_test.py`, `operators_cli_test.py`.
- 1671 tests passing, 2 skipped (WASM Rust compile requires `rustc` wasm32 target).

## v0.3.0

### Complete Features Repository
- Created comprehensive `examples/complete_features_XX.multi` files for all 17 supported languages.
- Each file demonstrates full language feature set: imports, functions, closures, classes, control flow, generators, exceptions, comprehensions, and advanced constructs.
- Ensures feature parity across all languages—if code works in English, equivalent translated code works identically in all other 16 languages.

### Frontend Equivalence
- Added an all-language full-pipeline regression test that starts from one core template, renders per-language keywords, transpiles, and executes for every supported language.
- Expanded equivalence validation to check deterministic transpiled Python parity across language frontends.

### Cross-Language Imports
- Added import-hook support for loading `.ml` modules and packages (`__init__.ml`) via Python import machinery.
- Enabled multilingual imports automatically in executor and REPL runtime paths.
- Added integration tests for English/French cross-imports, package imports, and manual enable/disable flow.

### Language Coverage
- Added five new European language packs: Polish (`pl`), Dutch (`nl`), Swedish (`sv`), Danish (`da`), and Finnish (`fi`).
- Localized keyword mappings, parser/semantic error messages, REPL help/messages/aliases, operator descriptions, and runtime builtin aliases for the new languages.
- Fixed legacy keyword placeholders surfaced by full-pipeline testing (Italian `IS`, Tamil `NOT`).
- All 17 languages now have complete feature coverage with working examples.

### Language Onboarding
- Added a contributor-ready onboarding checklist/template for new language packs.
- Added a `multilingual smoke` language-pack validation path and wired it into workflows.

### Tooling and Quality
- Strengthened CI gates with packaging sanity checks and CLI smoke runs in addition to tests/lint.
- Added cross-language import examples under `examples/` and updated docs (`README.md`, `USAGE.md`, `examples/README.md`).
- Test suite: 85 tests passing with zero regressions.

## v0.2.0

### Core Language
- Added a surface-normalization layer for selected alternate phrasing patterns.
- Expanded frontend equivalence coverage, including iterable-first loop variants.
- Added support for advanced constructs such as async flows, walrus operator, set literals, and dict unpacking.

### REPL and Execution
- Improved multilingual REPL usage with language switching and optional generated-Python display.
- Strengthened end-to-end parity across language frontends targeting one core execution path.

### Documentation and Positioning
- Refined README project positioning around "one programming model, many human languages."
- Added focused docs for naturalness, CNL scope, stdlib localization boundaries, and translation governance.

### Quality and Validation
- Expanded regression and equivalence tests across parser, core IR, runtime, and surface normalization.
- Updated package metadata and released as `0.2.0`.

## v0.1.0

### Core Language
- Expanded supported programming languages to 12: `en`, `fr`, `es`, `de`, `it`, `pt`, `hi`, `ar`, `bn`, `ta`, `zh`, `ja`.

- Added multilingual command aliases and localized help/messages.
- Added discovery commands:
  - `:kw [XX]` for language keywords
  - `:ops [XX]` for operators/symbols
- Localized REPL listing messages across supported languages.

### Runtime Builtins
- Introduced data-driven localized builtin aliases via `resources/usm/builtins_aliases.json`.
- Kept universal builtin names available while adding localized aliases (e.g., French `intervalle` for `range`).
- Runtime builtin alias loading is now dynamic in `RuntimeBuiltins`.

### Documentation
- Simplified and reorganized top-level documentation.
- Updated `README.md` with a clearer multilingual-first introduction and improved REPL guidance.
- Added extensive multilingual REPL smoke-test examples in `docs/reference.md`.
- Added `docs/language_onboarding.md` documenting the data-driven process for adding new languages.
- Improved cross-linking between `README.md`, `USAGE.md`, and `docs/reference.md`.
